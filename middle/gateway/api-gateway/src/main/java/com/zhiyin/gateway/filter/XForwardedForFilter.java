//Turns out the X-Forwarded-For header was taken from the original request feeding into Zuul to populate HttpServletRequest#getRemoteAddr(). This would then have to be passed on to the proxied backend services through RequestContext#getZuulRequestHeaders().put("X-Forwarded-For", remoteAddr). The following ZuulFilter accomplishes this, even if it isn't appending it's own value to the X-Forwarded-For filter just yet.
